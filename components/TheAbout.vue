          I am a 24-year web developer and photographer from Stockholm,
          currently living in Jönköping. Photography has been a career since 2015,
          but only doing photography didn't fully scratch my itch. I've had a growing
          interest and passion for coding since my discovery of HTML back in 2010.
          It all started with customizing the HTML on my teenage-girl blog,
          and I felt like I found the one thing I had always craved but never
          knew existed. Ever since this realization,
          I have spent countless hours studying new frameworks
          and programming languages. To complement my own studies,
          I decided to start studying Graphic Design and Web Development here
          in Jönköping.
